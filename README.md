Austin Breweries!

Here is a project that uses ETL method to obtain and visualize data about breweries in the Austin area.

Technologies used:
Python (beautiful soup) was utilized to webscrape data.
The list of breweries and addresses were obtained (webscraped) from https://bigworldsmallgirl.com/central-texas-brewery-guide/
A list of popular beers as well as information about the beers was obtained from Untappd.com which is an app that allows users to rate beers

Python API framework (Requests) was utilized to obtain brewery location data: latitude and longitude (Google map API)

Data was cleaned using Pandas, and then the data was uplodaded to a SQL database (Postgres).

An interactive Tableau dashboard was also created to visualize some of the date about the breweries such as the most popular and most highly rated breweries.
